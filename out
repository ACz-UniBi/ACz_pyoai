description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ["THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT ONLINE. A study into the uses of Internet by women's organizations in the Netherlands Arthur Edwards, Erasmus University Rotterdam Edwards@fsw.eur.nl Summary. This is an in-depth study of 12 organizations: six grass-roots organizations, three umbrella organizations and three service organizations within the Dutch women's movement. Also, six 'virtual organizations' (three portal sites, a platform site and two web organizations) were investigated. Apart from the service organizations, the uses of the Internet are almost limited to three communicative functions: information dissemi-nation and retrieval, recruitment and communication between the leaderships of organizations. Most organizations are leaving the 'homepage phase' of site development, but their current new ambitions seem to be more directed at applying network technology for purposes of internal communication than at interaction with the organization's environment. Until now, Internet uses had indeed some effects on the mobilization of resources, the relations with the environment and the 'management of frames', but these effects are almost limited to greater effectiveness and efficiency of existing action patterns. All organizations are now facing a situation in which the internal communication has to proceed along two speeds: only a part of the membership (individual members or member organizations) is online. The virtual organizations are more representative for the innovative potential of Internet. Together, they shape the contours of an information- and communication infrastructure for the women's movement in the information age."]

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['Met moderne beeldvormende technieken, de neuro-imaging-technieken, kan ge-meten worden waar en wanneer hersenactiviteit plaats vindt bij de uitvoering van een bepaalde taak. Zodoende kan de reactie van de hersenen gemeten worden op marketing stimuli zoals een reclamefilmpje of een verpakking, of als een klant moet kiezen tussen merken. In deze rede wordt een visie gegeven op de mogelijk-heden van onderzoek met behulp van hersenscans in marketing. De sterkten en zwakten van de vier belangrijkste neuro-imaging-technieken worden besproken (EEG, MEG, PET en fMRI), en de geschiktheid van deze technieken voor toepas-sing in marktonderzoek wordt bepaald. In een tweetal voorbeelden van consumen-tenonderzoek (reclameherinnering en merkkeuzeprocessen) worden de toepas-singsmogelijkheden ge??llustreerd. Er wordt geconcludeerd dat neuro-imaging unieke mogelijkheden opent voor marktonderzoek, maar dat nog veel fundamen-teel onderzoek nodig is voordat deze technieken ingezet kunnen worden in de praktijk. Het doel van neuromarketing is het beter begrijpen van de klant en haar reactie op marketing stimuli, door de processen in de hersenen direct te meten en in de theorievorming en stimuli-ontwikkeling te betrekken. Alhoewel de grootste nadruk ligt op het beter begrijpen van de klant door middel van theorievorming, moet het uiteindelijk ook de manager helpen bij het ontwerpen van effectievere marketing stimuli.', 'Modern neuroimaging techniques enable one to measure where and when brain activity takes place when executing a task. With these techniques, one can assess in a continuous, objective and accurate manner, the brain response of customers to marketing stimuli such as TV-commercials and assortments, or when choosing between brands. In this inaugural address, a perspective is given on the potential of measuring brain responses in marketing research. The strengths and weaknesses of four neuroimaging techniques are given (i.e., EEG, MEG, PET and fMRI) and the suitability of each technique for marketing research is discussed. In two consumer research examples (advertising recall and brand choice processes), the value of measuring brain activity is illustrated. It is concluded that neuroimaging opens unique opportunities for marketing research. However, much basic research is still required before these techniques can be applied in practice. The ultimate goal of neuromarketing is to improve our understanding of customer???s reactions to mar-keting stimuli by directly measuring the customer???s brain activity, and by incorpo-rating this brain response in the development of more effective marketing stimuli.']

The Congress took place at The Hague, December 12th 2000. This paper was published in the TRAIL Proceedings series (Delft: TRAIL Research School, October 30th 2000).', "Starting from their observation that in our society matters of spatial planning and of traffic and transport have become intertwined, and from their assessment that improvements can be made in the management of processes aimed at spatial investments, TRAIL and TNO Inro have formulated the Ph.D.project Strategy and project in the organization of planning and decision- making. Within the broader context of this Ph.D.- project the Dutch situation presents the introduction of the high-speed train, and the government program of 'Nieuwe Sleutelprojecten'. Here questions accumulate concerning the vitality of the urban fabric, rail transport innovation, and real estate development. The required process management tackling these spatial investments is in need of a framework from which its governance instruments can be implemented. The paper focusses on the redevelopment of railway station areas from the perspective of a geography of networks. Three questions structure this exploit. What concepts are useful for the study of both space and human interaction? 1.How do actors therein involved construct a strategy concerning the redevelopment of a railway station area? 2.How may management meet the diverging stakeholder demands concerning spatial investments?"]

Thisfinding is typically interpreted in terms of a risk averse representativeinvestor with a cubic utility function. This comment questions thisinterpretation.

However this class scheme does not deal adequately with the structural changes in the post-industrial economy. Esping-Andersen proposed a better-suited\nalternative. This article elaborates on this and focuses on two elements.\nFirstly, it presents a coding scheme for translating job-scores of the Dutch occupational classification (SBC-92) into scores of the Esping-Andersen scheme. Secondly, this scheme is applied to changes in the employment structure of the Netherlands and the two biggest cities in the Netherlands (Amsterdam and Rotterdam) between 1992 and 1996.\nThe article shows clearly the changing class structure of the Netherlands\nand the differences between the two cities. More important, however, is that the class structure of both cities evolves different. In Amsterdam the class structure of the traditional industrial sector (???the Fordist hierarchy???) professionalised, while the class structure of the post-industrial sector (???the post-Fordist hierarchy???) polarised. In Rotterdam the opposite holds true. These findings are highly relevant for recent discussions in urban sociology, and illustrate the relevance of the class-scheme of Esping-Andersen. The older EGP-scheme would not showed these diverging trends. Therefore it is necessary to use a class-scheme that accounts for the structural job changes related to the emerging post-industrial society.']

Using a survey design the association with several employee outcome variables is analysed. The results show that: 1) work system is an important factor for explaining differences in the quality of working life and attitudes of workers; 2) the Tayloristic work system clearly has detrimental effects on the well-being of workers. 3) in a survey design, comparing just teamworkers and non-teamworkers is not enough due to the heterogeneity of both categories.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['In this article some recent studies published by Dutch or Flemish authors on social inequality and class are discussed. In the Netherlands two main ?schools? are identified: the so-called ?Dutch stratification school?, which has its roots in modernization theory, and a ?Rotterdam? school (that actually is not a school at all). The article outlines some of the main strengths and weaknesses of both schools. After a discussion of recent Flemish studies of Hans de Witte, it is concluded that in theoretical and methodological perspective these Flemish studies are somewhere between the ?Dutch? and ?Rotterdam? school. It is then concluded that Dutch stratification research in general would benefit if both Dutch schools would more collaborate and learn from each other.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ["The Erikson Goldthorpe & Portocarero class scheme (EGP) has evolved to the standard indicator of class positions in international research. Critique with respect to the EGP service class is related to criticism regarding `The Constant Flux' (Erikson & Goldthorpe 1992). This work is mainly concerned with the classical theme of the shift from agriculture to industry and it neglects the important `post?industrial' distinction between the industrial and service sector. This criticism particularly applies to the `service class' as conceptualized by the EGP class scheme. It does not take important institutional changes in post-industrial society into account. Consequently, the life styles and beliefs of the 'service class' show a large amount of variation. We therefore propose to modify the EGP-class scheme by distinguishing the `social and cultural specialists' within the service class. Using the Dutch Family Survey (1992/93) we show that this adjustment of the EGP?class scheme is an improvement with respect to the explanation of a variety of attitudes and behaviour. The finding that our results hold after controlling for relevant predictors such as education, signifies the importance of our revision of the EGP-class scheme."]

Following the well-known ?flexible-firm?\nmodel van Atkinson and in accordance with segmentation theory, we can assume that flexible workers will have a worse labour market position compared to permanent workers. We have tested this assumption using two different indicators of the career of workers, respectively changes in the job level and chances to become unemployed. Our main conclusions are: 1) the job level of jobs held by flexible workers is somewhat lower compared to jobs held by permanent workers; 2) flexible workers have a somewhat higher chance to become unemployed compared to permanent workers; 3) there are large differences with respect to these two indicators between several categories of flexible workers. Overall, the empirical results give some support to the assumptions of segmentation theory. The rival ?waiting-room hypothesis? (which assumes that flexible workers will catch up an initial disadvantaged position) is not supported.']

We study the \neffects of collaborations on individual R&D effort, cost reduction, and market performance. \nWe then examine the incentives of firms to form collaborative links and the architecture of \nstrategically stable networks. Our analysis highlights the interaction between market \ncompetition and R&D network structure. We find that if firms are Cournot competitors then \nindividual R&D effort is declining in the level of collaborative activity. However, cost \nreduction and social welfare are maximized under an intermediate level of collaboration. \nIn some cases, firms can gain market power, and even induce exit of rival firms, by forming \nsuitable collaboration agreements. Moreover, under certain circumstances, such asymmetric \ncollaboration networks are also strategically stable. By contrast, if firms operate in \nindependent markets then individual R&D effort is increasing in the level of collaborative \nactivity.

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['Early retirement from the labour force has become standard practice for most employees in the industrialised world. However, as a result of the rising costs of early retirement schemes, curbing the outflow of older workers from the labour force has become a central government policy objective. Early retirement reforms under which benefits are financed on a more actuarially neutral basis are currently being implemented in the Netherlands. At present it is not clear how older workers will react to these policy reforms. In this paper we examine the extent to which (Dutch) older workers are inclined to change their retirement intentions in response to new early retirement arrangements. On the basis of a labour market and a population survey we examine retirement intentions under alternative early retirement policies. The overall conclusion is that the retirement reform may lead to a substantial delay of the retirement date, but that in practice more forces than the financial incentives are at work. This is also reflected in the long-run early retirement trend. This trend presents demographers and economists with a puzzle because a break shows up in the time series but this break has set in before the actual early retirement reforms were put into practice.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['Because of the dominant influence of the founder on his firm, research of small business start-ups is able to equate the individual and the firm levels of analysis. The behavior of the founder is then regarded as the behavior of the firm. Founder behavior with regard to strategy use can be studied by what they do (strategy content) and by how they do it (strategy process). This paper focuses on characteristics of the strategy process of individuals. The strategy process is operationalized by a behavioral measure of the manners in which small business founders deal with situations. A longitudinal analysis of 49 small business starters relating strategy use to firm performance suggests a dynamic process between strategy and performance. Business owners that perform poorly employ a Reactive Strategy, with poor performance leading to increased use of reactive behavior. High performing business owners start out focussing on the most crucial issues (Critical Point Strategy), with high performance leading to a more top-down (Complete Planning) approach. These relations are controlled for characteristics of the environment of the firm. Strategy use is dependent upon the type and level of environmental uncertainty. Complete Planning strategy is used less frequently in a fast changing environment and more often in a complex environment. Use of Opportunistic Strategy is negatively related to the complexity of the environment, while the Reactive Strategy is used more frequently in a non-munificent environment.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['In exploring the impact of tax policy on labor-market performance, the paper first investigates how tax reform impacts labor supply and equilibrium unemployment in representative agent models. The impact of tax policy on labor market performance depends importantly on various other labor-market institutions, such as minimum wage laws, wage bargaining, and unemployment benefits. In non-competitive labor markets, employment declines if a higher tax burden makes the outside option (i.e. unemployment) relatively more attractive. Marginal tax rates typically differ substantially across individuals. To explore the impact of specific tax policies, therefore, the paper relies on an applied general equilibrium model to investigate the consequences of tax reform with heterogeneous households. The model simulations reveal several trade-offs between various objectives, such as cutting unemployment, stimulating the participation of secondary workers into the labor force, raising the quality and quantity of labor supply, and establishing an equitable income distribution. The paper also analyses how efficiency considerations affect the optimal progressiveness of labor income taxes. Finally, the optimal progression of the labor income tax is investigated in the presence of search unemployment, heterogeneous households and distributional concerns.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['This article presents a novel approach for calculating swap vega\nper bucket in the Libor BGM model. We show that for some forms of the\nvolatility an approach based on re-calibration may lead to a large uncertainty\nin estimated swap vega, as the instantaneous volatility structure may\nbe distorted by re-calibration. This does not happen in the case of constant\nswap rate volatility. We then derive an alternative approach, not based on\nre-calibration, by comparison with the swap market model. The strength of\nthe method is that it accurately estimates vegas for any volatility function\nand at a low number of simulation paths. The key to the method is that\nthe perturbation in the Libor volatility is distributed in a clear, stable and\nwell understood fashion, whereas in the re-calibration method the change in\nvolatility is hidden and potentially unstable.']

In revenue management the capacities of the business and economy class sections of the plane are traditionally considered to be fixed and distinct capacities. In this paper, we give up this notion and instead consider the use of convertible seats. A row of these seats can be converted from business class seats to economy class seats and vice versa. This offers an airline company the possibility to adjust the capacity configuration of the plane to the demand pattern at hand. We show how to incorporate the shifting capacity opportunity into a dynamic, network-based revenue management model. We also extend the model to include cancellations and overbooking. With a small test case we show that incorporating the shifting capacity opportunity into the revenue management decision indeed provides a means to improve revenues.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u"The \u201cnatural habitat\u201d of H. pylori within the human body seems to be the gastric mucus and the mucus-producing epithelium. The question is; what is so special about the gastric mucus that H. pylori can establish itself there? This mucus-layer, like all the mucus-layers in the body, is composed of mucins; large glycoproteins that are able form watery gels to protect the underlying epithelium. Several questions immediately arise, each of which we will try to answer in this thesis: 1. What is the nature of the gastric mucin? 2. What is the nature of the interaction between the bacterium and the mucin? 3. Can the expression of this gastric mucin sufficiently explain the gastric tropism towards the stomach? 4. Which mucins, or other secretory proteins, are produced in the metaplastic epithelia within the upper GI tract, and can this knowledge help us understand the underlying pathology and the role of H. pylori herein?\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Helicobacter pylori shows a characteristic tropism for the mucus-producing gastric epithelium. In infected patients, H. pylori colocalizes in situ with the gastric secretory mucin MUC5AC. The carbohydrate blood-group antigen Lewis B (LeB) was deemed responsible for the adherence of H. pylori to the gastric surface epithelium. We sought to determine if MUC5AC is the carrier of LeB, and thus if MUC5AC is the underlying gene product functioning as the main receptor for H. pylori in the stomach. METHODS: We studied three types of human tissue producing MUC5AC: Barrett's esophagus (BE), normal gastric tissue, and gastric metaplasia of the duodenum (GMD). Tissue sections were immuno-fluorescently stained for MUC5AC or LeB, and subsequently incubated with one of three strains of Texas red-labeled H. pylori, one of which was unable to bind to LeB. We determined the colocalization of MUC5AC or LeB with adherent H. pylori. RESULTS: The binding patterns for the two LeB-binding strains to all tissues were similar, whereas the strain unable to bind to LeB did not bind to any of the tissues. In normal gastric tissue, the LeB-binding strains always bound to MUC5AC- and LeB-positive epithelial cells. In four nonsecretor patients, colocalization of the LeB-binding strains was found to MUC5AC-positive gastric epithelial cells. In BE, the LeB-binding H. pylori strains colocalized very specifically to MUC5AC-positive cells. MUC5AC-producing cells in GMD contained LeB. Yet, LeB-binding H. pylori not only colocalized to MUC5AC or LeB present in GMD, but also bound to the LeB-positive brush border of normal duodenal epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Mucin MUC5AC is the most important carrier of the LeB carbohydrate structure in normal gastric tissue and forms the major receptor for H. pylori."]

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['Glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. When left untreated, glaucoma results in visual field loss and eventually in blindness. In considering the diagnosis of glaucoma, the physician will evaluate the intraocular pressure, the optic nerve head and the visual field. This seems to be a straightforward diagnostic process, but, surprisingly, there is still no consensus on the criteria for the signs on which the diagnosis is based.\nGlaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by death of retinal ganglion cells. The course of events that eventually leads to death of these cells is not exactly known, but the retinal nerve fiber layer, which is made up of the axons of the retinal ganglion cells, thins. Scanning laser polarimetry is an imaging technique that can detect glaucoma by assessing the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer.\nScanning laser polarimetry came onto the market in 1993. The working principle is based on the fact that in the nerve fiber layer a phase shift occurs in polarized laser light that is sent through the nerve fiber layer. This so called retardation is thought to be linearly correlated with nerve fiber layer thickness. In the past, scanning laser polarimetry has shown to discriminate well between normal and glaucomatous eyes.\nThe goal of this thesis was to investigate the clinical performance of the GDx (a revised version of the first scanning laser polarimeter, the Nerve Fiber Analyzer).\nIn summary, the GDx provides fast, objective and quantitative data on nerve fiber layer thickness. The applicability and reproducibility of measurements are high and the image acquisition is user and patient friendly. The GDx yields useful sensitivity and specificity values for the detection of glaucoma, whereas its role in follow-up remains to be investigated. As it stands, the GDx holds insufficient validity to serve as a single test for glaucoma. It does, however, provide a very useful addition to the existing tests we run in patients to make the correct diagnosis.']

In this paper, we introduce smooth transition models to study reference-based price response across 25 fast moving consumer good categories. Our application to 100 brands shows that 77% demonstrate reference-based price response, of which 36% reflects historical reference prices, 31% reflects competitive reference prices, and 33% reflects both types of reference prices. This reference-based price response shows asymmetry for gains versus losses on three levels: the threshold size, the sign and the magnitude of the elasticity difference. For historical reference prices, the threshold size is larger for gains (20%) than for losses (12%) and the assimilation/contrast effects for gains (-0.41) are smaller than the saturation effects for losses (0.81). For competitive reference prices, the threshold size is smaller for gains (3%) than for losses (16%), and the saturation effects are larger for gains (0.33) than for losses (0.15). These results are moderated by both brand and category characteristics that affect reference price accessibility and diagnosticity. Historical reference prices more often play a role for national brands, for planned purchases and in inexpensive categories with low price volatility and high purchase frequency. When price discounting, high-share brands face larger latitudes of acceptance. When raising prices, saturation effects set in later for brands with high price volatility and for categories with high price spread and for planned purchases.

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u'We investigated the human ability to align visually and kinaesthetically perceived end positions of arm movements. We specifically looked at the spatial characteristics of movement endpoints and the responses of the visuomotor system to altered relationships between visual and kinaesthetic information. In these studies we tried to determine what spatial information is incorporated in the motor commands generated by the visuomotor system and how this spatial information is represented. The tasks and experimental setup in the present studies were designed to study three-dimensional arm movements with the above-mentioned factors in mind.\nThe main aim of the present research was to reveal the nature of visuomotor coordination. However, the paradigm used also serves to assess the adaptability of the visuomotor system. This may have implications for \u2019real-life\u2019 situations in which humans are confronted with discrepant sensory information. Discrepancies between what we feel and what we see are present in nearly all man-machine interactions, for instance, in teleoperation. Depending on the circumstances and the task at hand this may impose major demands on the operator and may lead to serious accidents. Endoscopic surgery is seen as complicated and difficult to learn. Knowledge about the way the visuomotor system is organised and the processes by which adaptation occurs may help to identify the crucial difficulties encountered when using complex tools and contribute to the development of appropriate training programs.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u'It is widely believed that job insecurity in industrial societies is on the increase. In particular, several studies have argued that the job insecurity of the (higher) middle class has substantially risen in the eighties and nineties. In this article the question whether or not this is true is investigated. The effect of job insecurity on union membership is also looked at. To answer the research questions we use survey data of 1992, 1994, and 1996. We only use data about workers in paid employment working at least 11 hours a week. The job insecurity of the workers is measured with three indicators: 1) actual unemployment; 2) perceived job insecurity; 3) numerical flexibility.\nAccording to these indicators job security in the Netherlands is still\nsubstantially high. However, especially the perceived insecurity and the\nnumerical flexibility have slightly risen in the 1992-1996 period. Contrary to our expectations, job security of the higher middle class is still relatively high compared to the working class. However, our data also show that the job (in)security of the lower middle class seems to be converging with the working class.\nOur findings show that job insecurity has only minor \u2013 and mostly\nstatistically insignificant - effects on union membership. Moreover,\nnumerically flexible workers less often join a union than workers with a\nmore secure labour contract. However, it is important to note that with\nrespect to union membership members of the middle class \u2013 contrary to\nexpectations put forward in the literature \u2013do not react differently on job insecurity than members of the working class.']

To what extent students occupy jobs for which the low-educated umployed also qualify is subject of this study. By means of three separate empirical studies among: a) students in higher education, b) the low-educated unemployed and c) employers this question was evaluated. Occupation of jobs suitable for the low-educated unemployed by students is substantial and takes place especially in sectors such as: retail trade/shops, hotel and catering and industry. Motives of employers for recruting students in stead of low-educated persons refer in particular to their perceived communication skills, flexibility and their by comparison less need for settle in work time.']

Twee\naspecten daarvan zijn onderzocht: de beroepsstatus en de kans op\nwerkloosheid. Op basis van de familie-enqu\xeate 2000 worden twee centrale\nhypothesen getoetst met betrekking tot de mogelijk negatieve\nlangetermijneffecten van het hebben van een flexibele baan. De eerste, de\nwachtkamerhypothese, stelt dat de negatieve gevolgen van een flexibele baan\nslechts tijdelijk zijn, omdat deze een opstap vormt voor een vaste baan. De\ntweede hypothese, de segmentatiehypothese, stelt dat het hebben van een\nflexibele baan een blijvend negatief effect heeft. De analyse van de\nberoepsstatus in dit artikel geeft steun aan de segmentatiehypothese. De\nanalyse van de kans op werkloosheid daarentegen weerspreekt beide\nhypothesen. De veronderstelling dat de negatieve langetermijneffecten van\nflexibele arbeid voor zwakke groepen op de arbeidsmarkt extra negatief\nuitpakken, wordt slechts \u2013 wat betreft de beroepsstatus \u2013 voor jongeren\nbevestigd.']

Zo zien we tijdens de regeringsperiode van de Nationale Partij bijvoorbeeld grote aandacht voor De Grote Trek en de Boerenoorlogen. Nu wordt binnen het ANC driftig gediscussieerd over de eigen geschiedenis en de gewenste representatie daarvan. In dit artikel wordt ingegaan op deze strijd om de collectieve herinnering.']

Dat is een van de redenen geweest waarom de oorlog zo lang werd voortgezet toen hij in 1943 al definitief was verloren. In dit artikel wordt de vraag behandeld waarom ook na de oorlog in de Duitse militaire geschiedschrijving de visie op de gebeurtenissen vaak niet voldoende realistisch geweest is. In de jaren tachtig lijkt daar een kentering ingekomen, maar na de eenwording is er toch weer sprake van zekere gewenste bijstellingen van de herinnering aan de oorlog.']

His research interests include the study of the impact of HRM on organisational performance and employee well-being, the transformation of work and employment relations in the service sector, and the nature and consequences of employee empowerment, partnership and participation in contemporary organisations. He is particularly interested in multilevel analysis and in the study of macro-micro-macro relationships in OB and HRM. Within this perspective, together with colleagues from King\u2019s, Birkbeck College and the London School of Economics he has recently completed a series of studies on the impact of gender similarity/diversity on employee satisfaction and commitment at work, on the antecedents and consequences of information disclosure in Britain, and on the evaluation of the impact of the role of nurse consultants in the UK National Health Service. He publishes widely in internationally oriented journals such as the Journal of Management Studies, the British Journal of Industrial Relations, Work, Employment and Society, and The International Journal of Human Resource Management.', u'The analysis of the impact of human resource (HR) practices on employee well-being at work is an important yet relatively neglected area of inquiry within the field of human resource management (HRM). In this inaugural address, the main findings from ongoing research based on data from the 1998 British Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS98) are presented. These suggest that the HR practices that are adopted by organisations have a significant impact on the well-being of their workforces and that this impact tends, on the whole, to be more positive than negative. The effects, however, are more complex than is normally assumed in the literature. In particular, preliminary results indicate that the constellation of HR practices that help to maximise employee well-being (i.e. that make for happy workplaces), are not necessarily the same as those that make up the type of \u2018High Performance Work Systems\u2019 commonly identified in the literature. This has important theoretical, policy and ethical implications for the field of HRM. These are discussed along with important directions for future research.', u'Erasmus University Rotterdam.

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u'Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with a variety of both infectious and malignant human diseases. These viruses are characterized by (B-cell) lymphotropism, their ability to establish latent infection in host cells and to induce proliferation of these latently infected cells. Approximately 90% of humans will become infected with EBV, generally without clinical evidence of disease. Primary infection usually occurs asymptomatically in childhood and results in a lifetime carrier state with periodic release of infectious virus into saliva which may cause infection of naive individuals. E.g. during adolescence, the latter type of infection may be referred to as kissing disease or Pfeiffer\u2019s disease. EBV causes various benign syndromes, such as infectious mononucleosis, chronic active EBV infection, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease and oral hairy leukoplakia. EBV has also been associated with malignant diseases including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). PTLD refer to a range of hyperplastic to neoplastic lymphoid proliferations which occur after solid organ- or bone marrow transplantation, they mostly are of B-cell origin, and commonly (90%) contain EBV. \nThe lack of early and accurate markers of EBV reactivation and disease has long hampered a timely diagnosis of post-transplant EBV lymphoproliferative disease. The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, however, has allowed for sensitive and quantitative monitoring of viral DNA in peripheral blood samples. This thesis has addressed the question whether molecular monitoring of EBV-DNA would accurately predict for EBV-LPD and whether preventive and therapeutic strategies could be developed based on viral load monitoring.']

Hypermobility of stiffnes of the joint was determined by Doppler imaging of vibrations and by radiographic stress measurement. With neither method a sharp distinction between hypermobility and non-hypermobility of the joint could be made. Comparison of the Hohmann surgical procedure with the Lapidus procedure showed no difference in clinical results at short term follow up. Hence the significance of hypermobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint and the type of surgical correction of it remain subject of future research.']

The results are based on the Rotterdam Study, a large population based cohort study among 7,983 persons aged 55 years or older. A total of 7,721 persons were free from previous stroke. The cohort was followed for morbidity, including stroke. The incidence rate increased with age and was higher in men than in women over the entire age range. We found that an increased wall thickness did not only increase the risk of stroke, but also the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and lacunar infarction, irrespective of cardiovascular risk factors. The relevance of carotid plaques in persons without a previous stroke or TIA was not yet clear. Estradiol was not related to the risk of stroke, neither in men nor in women. Our results are in line with recent clinical trials that failed to report a beneficial effect from estrogen replacement therapy on the risk of stroke. A decreased testosterone level was related to an increased risk of stroke in men, in particular in those who did not smoke. We report that there is no clear relation between the Dallele in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and risk of stroke. The relation between mutations in the hemochromatosis gene and stroke: two mutations (C282 and H63D) were related to the risk of stroke and increased carotid intima-media thickness in persons who smoked or had hypertension.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u'Increasingly, it has been recognised that in their process of internationalisation multinationals may learn. They may take a strategy not only of exploitation, to leverage existing assets, competencies and products, built up in their home countries, but also, and perhaps even primarily, of exploration, to profit from diversity of host countries to develop new products and competencies.

They may take a strategy not only of exploitation, to leverage existing assets, competencies and products, built up in their home countries, but also, and perhaps even primarily, of exploration, to profit from diversity of host countries to develop new products and competencies.

The three main questions in this thesis were: (1) How do recently diagnosed patients and their partners perceive the risk of wheelchair dependence? (2) How do perceptions of risk relate to psychological well-being? (3) What are the determinants of perception of prognostic risk? Before answering these key questions, the psychological burden of disease and the quality of life (QoL) of patients and partners in the early phase of MS are examined.\nIt was demonstrated that the early period after diagnosis of MS puts a substantial emotional burden on patients and their partners. Patients and partners overestimated the short- and medium-term risks of wheelchair dependence, but underestimated the lifetime risk. Moreover, higher perceptions of the short- and medium risks were found among patients with higher symptom perception, and were associated with poorer psychological well-being. These findings are interpreted from a psychological and clinical perspective.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ["This thesis is aimed at understanding the relationship between the genetic defects that cause steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency and the clinical phenotype, and the molecular mechanisms that create these mutations in the CYP21 gene, in a patient population from the Netherlands. Soon after the discovery of the CYP21 gene and the nearby CYP21P pseudogene, a picture emerged of great variability in the arrangement of these genes on chromosome 6p21.31. Some of these variants constitute genetic defects that cause steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency. \nThe study's initial objective was therefore to obtain an image of that variability by charting the layout of the genetic environment of the CYP21 gene in steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency patients and in the general population. Two genetic mechanisms that are fundamental to the evolution of the genome, and especially the MHC, are also instrumental in generating the variability in this region:\n- simultaneous deletion and duplication of genes by unequal crossover, and:\n- non-reciprocal sequence transfer between genes by gene conversion.\nA major point of attention in this thesis is how these mechanisms create alleles that carry steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\nFor genetic analysis of CYP21 defects, it is often assumed that a chromosome either carries a CYP21 gene, or has a CYP21 deletion. Chapter 7 demonstrates that this assumption is not without risk: chromosomes with two CYP21 genes in tandem are found in the general population at a frequency equal to or higher than steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency alleles. Since one of the two CYP21 genes is defective on such chromosomes, PCR-based mutation analysis without haplotyping can lead to erroneous assignment of carrier status."]

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u'In this essay, we challenge the present dominant emphasis in the Dutch Innovation Debate on the creation of technological innovations, the focus on a few core technologies, and the allocation of more financial resources. We argue that managerial capabilities and organizing principles for innovation should have a higher priority on the Dutch Innovation Agenda. Managerial capabilities for innovation deal with cognitive elements such as the capacity to absorb knowledge, create entrepreneurial mindsets, and facilitate managerial experimentation and higher-order learning abilities. These capacities can only be developed by distinctive managerial roles that enhance hierarchy, teaming and shared norms. Utilizing these unique managerial capabilities requires novel organizing principles, such as managing internal rates of change, nurturing self-organization and balancing high levels of exploration and exploitation. These managerial capabilities and organizing principles of innovation create new sources of productivity growth and competitive advantage.\n\nThe dramatic fall back of the Netherlands in the league of innovative and high productivity countries of the World Economic Forum-Report can be mainly attributed to the present lack in the Netherlands of these key managerial and organizational enablers of innovation and productivity growth. We provide various levers for building unique managerial capabilities and novel organizing principles of innovation. Moreover, we describe the necessary roles that different actors have to play in this innovation arena. In particular, we focus on the often neglected but important role of strategic regulations that speed up innovation and productivity growth. They are the least expensive way to boost innovation in organizations in both the Dutch private and public sector. \n\nFinally, we discuss the implications for the Dutch Innovation Agenda. It should start with setting a challenging ambition, namely the return of The Netherlands within the WEF- league of the top-ten most innovative and productive countries of the world. Considering the under-utilization of available knowledge stemming from technological innovations, managerial and organizational determinants of innovation should receive first priority. These determinants have a high strategic relevance and should receive more public recognition. We suggest to organize an annual innovation ranking of the most outstanding Dutch firms, to develop an innovation audit that measures firms\u2019 non-technological innovation capacity, and to create an overall innovation policy for fast diffusion of new managerial capabilities and adequate organizing principles throughout the Dutch private and public sector.\nIn conclusion, we add five new items to the Dutch Innovation Agenda:\n\n1.\tPrioritize administrative innovations\nInvestments in management and organization determinants of absorption of knowledge and its successful application (administrative innovation) should have a higher priority than investments in technological innovations.\n2.\tBuild new managerial capabilities and develop novel organizing principles\nFor these administrative innovations to succeed, firms have to build managerial capabilities (broad knowledge-base, absorptive capacity, managerial experimentation, higher-order learning) and various management roles (hierarchy, teaming, shared norms) to increase the assimilation of external knowledge and the utilization for innovation.

Today an increasing flow of products is going back in the chain. Thus, companies have to manage reverse logistics as well.This thesis contributes to a better understanding of reverse logistics. The thesis brings insights on reverse logistics decision-making and it lays down theoretical principles for reverse logistics as a research field.In particular it puts together a framework for reverse logistics identifying the elementary dimensions, providing typologies, and structuring their interrelations.With respect to aiding decision-making, this thesis comprises return handling and inventory management. On the first, the focus is on critical factors for the combination vs. separation of reverse and forward flows during material handling. On the second, the main research issue is the value of information. One of the findings is that more informed methods do not necessarily lead to the best performance.Furthermore, this thesis proposes a reflection on the future development of the field.  Through a Delphi study with an international panel of academics working on the area, recommendations are made concerning both research and pedagogy. This thesis also poses the following question: is it a matter of simply managing reverse logistics or of reversing logistics management?The message is: logistics cannot go forward without reverse thinking!', u'Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM), Promoteres: Prof.dr.ir.

Clusters worden veelvuldig onderzocht, maar een coherent raamwerk om de performance van clusters te onderzoeken ontbreekt. In dit proefschrift wordt een dergelijk raamwerk ontwikkeld, op basis van inzichten uit de bestaande literatuur. Centraal in het raamwerk is een onderscheid tussen de \u2018governance\u2019 en de structuur van de cluster. Er worden vier structuur gerelateerde variabelen geidentificeerd: agglomeratie voor- en nadelen, interne concurrentie, hetereogeniteit van bedrijven in de cluster en cluster drempels. Er worden ook vier governance-gerelateerde variabelen onderscheiden: vertrouwen, intermediairs, \u2018leader firms\u2019 en collectieve actie regimes.In het empirisch onderzoek, drie cases van de havenclusters in Rotterdam, Durban en de Beneden-Mississippi, wordt de relevantie van deze variabelen gevalideerd. Het belang van de variabelen, de sterktes en zwaktes van de drie havenclusters en kansen voor beleid en management in de havenclusters worden besproken.De onderzoeksresultaten zijn relevant voor onderzoekers gespecialiseerd in clusters en voor onderzoekers die zich met havens bezighouden. Daarnaast is het onderzoek relevant voor managers van bedrijven en overheidsinstanties die opereren in clusters.', 'This PhD thesis deals with the performance of clusters. Even though cluster studies are numerous, a coherent framework to analyze cluster performance is lacking. In this thesis, such a framework is developed, drawing from different schools that deal with clusters. Central in the framework is a distinction to variables of cluster performance related to the structure of a cluster and variables related to the governance of a cluster. Four structure variables - agglomeration ands disagglomeration forces, internal competition, heterogeneity of the cluster and the level of entry and exit barriers - and four governance related variables - the presence of trust, the presence of intermediaries, the presence of leader firms and the quality of collective action regimes - are identified and discussed. The validity of these variables is confirmed in the three case studies, of the port clusters of Rotterdam, Durban, and the lower Mississippi. The strengths and weaknesses of the three port clusters, the importance of the variables discussed above and opportunities for policy and management to improve the performance of clusters are discussed.The results of this study are relevant for cluster scholars and for scholars specializing in port studies. The thesis is also relevant for (port) cluster managers and for managers of firms in (port) clusters, since implications of this study for policy and management in (port) clusters are discussed.', 'Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM).

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u'Hemoglobin is the carrier of oxygen in the bloodstream. It is a tetrameric protein composed of two \u03b1-globin chains and two \u03b2-globin chains. These chains are encoded by the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin gene loci. The globin loci are located on separate chromosomes and are composed of several developmentally regulated genes and regulatory elements located both upstream of the gene loci and around the individual genes. Lesions in the globin clusters give rise to blood disorders known as hemoglobinopathies. The study of the molecular basis of these disorders led to the identification of many regulatory elements of the globin loci, including the locus control region (LCR). The \u03b2-globin locus is one of the best-studied multi gene loci and has been extensively used as a model system for the study of gene regulation. The aims of this thesis are to study the mechanism of transcriptional activation of the globin loci, the role of the hypersensitive sites in LCR function and the further characterisation of putative \u03b3-globin regulatory elements. \nIn conclusion, the studies presented here show:\n1. that there is evidence for a stochastic basis for activation of globin gene expression;\n2. that the LCR does function as a holocomplex, but also that the individual hypersensitive  sites act differently on each globin gene; \n3. that the regulation of the individual globin genes is very complex and probably involves the  interaction of various combinations of elements during different stages of development.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u'Age-related maculopathy (ARM) is a severe threat to the visual ability of people over 65 years of age. In the late stages of ARM, called age-related macular degeneration (AMD), photoreceptor cells gradually disappear. New vessels growing beneath the retina may complicateb the disease; this is called \xe2\x80\x98wet\xe2\x80\x99 or neovascular AMD. Knowledge about causes and pathogenesis of this eye disease could lead to therapies, and probably even more important, to strategies that prevent the disease from occurring. The purpose of this thesis was to study several of many molecular changes that occur during the development of ARM.\nGrowth factors play a role in choroidal neovascularization. With advancing age, the thickness of the retina decreases. Little is known about the way cells disappear during this process. Apoptosis was studied in the macula of rhesus monkeys of different ages. The findings indicate that apoptosis in the primate macula occurs at all ages at similar rate, possibly increasing in the oldest age group, and may account for the decreasing thickness of the primate macula with age. It appears to be unlikely that Fas-ligand (FasL) expressed on retinal pigment epithelium controls the extension of choroidal neovascularization. Several growth factors could be involved in the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD. The results may point towards a role of the Insulinlike Growth Factors in the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD.\nSomatostatin reduces newly formed vessels by inhibiting the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor axis and also has a direct anti-proliferative effect on various cell types involved in angiogenesis. It is demonstrated that most early-formed choroidal neovascularization in eyes of patients with AMD express sst2A, which is a receptor for somatostatin. The sst2A receptor binds potential anti-angiogenic somatostatin-analogues like octreotide. Therefore, somatostatin analogues may be an effective therapy in early stages of neovascular AMD.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['Colorectal cancer is a major public health problem in many countries. In 1997, approximately 8,500 new cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed in the Netherlands and more than 4,000 individuals died from this disease. Screening for colorectal cancer in the general population has the potential to save lives. Potential screening tests are the fecal occult blood test (FOBT), colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. FOBT tests detect blood in stool from bleeding asymptomatic colorectal cancer or large adenomas. Sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are both endoscopic tests that visualize the colorectal tract. If adenomas, precursors of cancer, are detected at the screening test, they can be removed immediately.\nIt is recommended that patients with removed adenomas undergo regular colonoscopic surveillance. In this thesis, aspects of colorectal cancer screening and of colonoscopic surveillance (follow-up) of adenoma patients are studied by analysis of relevant data and with the use of the MISCAN-COLON model. This is a micro-simulation model that simulates a large number of fictitious individual life histories. The three main uses of the model are analysis of data of population studies in the field of screening and surveillance of adenoma patients, testing of hypotheses about the natural history of adenomas and colorectal cancer, and evaluation of screening policies.\nGeneral conclusions The MISCAN-COLON model is a useful tool for the analysis of screening and surveillance studies and for the evaluation of screening strategies. A wide variation is seen among the different models regarding the assumptions on the adenoma dwell time and the percentage of colorectal cancers that originate from adenomas. Screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood tests reduces colorectal cancer mortality and is cost-effective.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u'Een terugbik op de geschiedenis van het waterbeheer laat zien, dat de mensheid altijd grote fouten heeft gemaakt in de omgang\nmet water. En veel van de fouten worden ook nu nog gemaakt. Door onvoldoende rekening te houden met ecologische\nnatuurwetten loopt de mensheid het risico in de volgende eeuw geconfronteerd te worden met overstromingen en droogtes,\nwater- en voedseltekorten en uit de hand lopende conflicten over water. Daarbij kunnen aantallen slachtoffers vallen die het\nvoorstellingsvermogen te boven gaan. Om het tij te keren is een fundamenteel andere omgang met water nodig. We moeten onze\nwatersystemen niet langer beschouwen als last of als goedkoop produktiemiddel, maar veel meer als \u2018eco-fabrieken\u2019 waar\nproducten en diensten worden geproduceerd waar de maatschappij behoefte aan heeft. Daarbij moeten we de uitgestoken hand\nvan Moeder Natuur niet langer afwijzen, maar juist dankbaar aanvaarden. Dus geen strijd tegen het water, maar meekoppelen\nmet de natuur. De waterbeheerders van de volgende eeuw zullen pragmatisch moeten omgaan met ecologische natuurwetten, en\ngebruik maken van de stuurbare mogelijkheden die ecosystemen bieden. Dit keer gaat het niet over mogen en moeten, maar\nover durven en doen.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['In dit artikel wordt vanuit een mondiaal perspectief ingegaan op de problematische situatie rond de beschikbaarheid van zoetwater, nu en in de komende 100 jaar, en de dreigingen die daarvan uitgaan voor het functioneren van ecosystemen, sociaal-economische ontwikkeling, en maatschappelijk-politieke stabiliteit. Zoetwater op aarde blijkt een in toenemende mate schaarse en onvervangbare grondstof te zijn, en van nature ongelijk verdeeld. Menselijk ingrijpen in grote riviersystemen (dammen, stuwen) en sectorale en lokale afwegingsmechanismen hebben deze ongelijkheid verder vergroot. De auteurs illustreren dit met voorbeelden van de Amazone, de Eufraat en de Tigris, de Aralzee en het Rijnstroomgebied. Een explosieve toename van de wereldbevolking en een sterke urbanisatie zullen de problemen verder verscherpen. Het nieuwe fenomeen van "eco-vluchtelingen" \'wordt beschreven. De auteurs verwachten dat, zonder een integrale stroomgebiedsbenadering, de olie-crississen van deze eeuw zullen verbleken bij de water-crisissen in de 21ste eeuw. Voor Nederland komen de auteurs tot de conclusie, dat Nederland voor zijn zoetwater voorziening vrijwel volledig afhankelijk is van het buitenland en zich daarmee in een uiterst kwetsbare positie bevindt.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) often leads to serious activity limitations in everyday life. To date, however, limitations in patients with CRPS1 of an upper limb have not been objectively measured.Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an upper limb-activity monitor (ULAM), and to determine the applicability of the ULAM. Because the ULAM is relatively new and its measurement technique clearly differs from what is commonly used in research and clinic with respect to several methodological and practical criteria, we studied how the ULAM outcome measures were related to four questionnaires that also aim to assess the functional consequences of diseases.\nIt was concluded that the current ULAM has the potential to validly assess upper limb activity over time in upper limb CRPSI.\n\n In ten female chronic CRPS1 patients and ten healthy control subjects, 24-h activity patterns were measured with the ULAM. This ULAM consists of body-fixed acceleration sensors, connected to a recorder worn around the waist. The ULAM automatically detects upper limb activity during mobility-related activities. Several outcome measures related to general mobility and upper limb usage were compared between patients and controls. The results showed that CRPSI in the dominant upper limb had modest impact on general mobility; i.e. on the percentages spent in body positions and body motions and on mean intensity of body activity. For upper limb usage outcome measures during sitting, there was a marked difference between CRPS1 patients and controls. Especially patients with dominant side involvement clearly showed less activity of their involved limb during sitting, indicated by significant differences for the mean intensity (P=0.014), percentage (P=0.004), and proportion (P=0.032) of upper limb activity. It is concluded that these ten chronic CRPS1 patients still had limitations in upper limb usage during everyday life, 3.7 years (average) after the causative event.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['he goal of this thesis was to develop an objective and valid methodology to support the choice for a particular aortic valve substitute in the individual patient, with a primary focus on autografts and allografts. This includes the important question: Can patient-specific recommendations be made with regard to the preferred valve substitute for patients requiring aortic valve replacement, based on the methodology described in this thesis? This question will be discussed by: (1) Commenting on the current clinical evidence on outcome after aortic root replacement with autografts and allografts, (2) Critically evaluating the methods of meta-analysis and microsimulation with regard to their ability to predict outcome after aortic valve replacement, (3) Comparing calculated outcome after autograft versus allograft aortic root replacement, and versus other valve substitutes, and finally to actual situations.\nIn conclusion, clinical experience with autograft and allograft aortic root replacement turned out to be limited, both with regard to number of patients and duration of follow-up. Meta-analysis and microsimulation provide an objective and flexible tool to overcome these limitations and allow calculations of long-term prognosis after autograft and allograft aortic root replacement based on current limited evidence. Using this methodology, detailed information can be obtained on the determinants of prognosis, providing improved insight into outcome after autograft and allograft aortic root replacement. However, both meta-analysis and microsimulation have their limitations and the output of the microsimulation model strongly depends on the quality of the input and the assumptions of the model. Continuous refinement and updating of the microsimulation model are therefore necessary to provide objective and valid estimates of outcome after aortic valve replacement in the future. Furthermore, education of clinicians on the methodology of microsimulation is essential for successful application in clinical practice. An internet application of the model should become available in the near future for easy access use by clinicians.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['n conclusion we developed a model to monitor the oxidation of liver glycogen. Our studies showed that it was possible to label the liver glycogen with naturally 13C-enriched carbohydrate and to monitor its oxidation. 13C-enriched muscle glycogen did not interfere with the test within the test conditions. The test design and the tests results were confirmed by using the inverse test set-up in persons who were used to a habitual diet of 13C-enriched carbohydrates. The test was reasonably reproducible within the same persons, though the study group was small. Extending the dietary 13C-enrichment from one to three days did alter the test results. These alterations were small and possibly of no clinical importance. A pilot study showed that the test indeed is capable of detecting differences in glycogen oxidation between cirrhotics and healthy individuals.\nThe clinical application of the test needs further validation by comparing it with other techniques such as the NMR. The studies described in this thesis demonstrate the feasibility of using naturally isotope enriched products for metabolic studies. This breath test is relatively simple to perform as a bedside test and makes use of inexpensive substrates. For a metabolic test to evaluate a complex process, it is reasonably reproducible.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u'De auteur schetst eerst kort het zware weer in de Nederlandse pensioenpolder alsmede de huidige deadlock tussen de overheid en de pensioenwereld. Om uit deze impasse te geraken moeten de verantwoordelijkheden van overheid en sociale partners helder zijn: de sociale partners zijn verantwoordelijk voor het pensioencontract. Vervolgens wordt een duivelse driehoek beschreven die de sociale partners parten speelt bij het expliciteren van pensioencontracten. Daarna presenteert de auteur twee manieren waarop de pensioenleeftijd deze duivelse driehoek onschadelijk kan maken. Houdbare solidariteit met kwetsbare ouderen wordt zo verzoend met een sterke, dynamische kenniseconomie waarin menselijk kapitaal beter wordt onderhouden en mensen risico\u2019s aankunnen.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() ['Dutch municipalities have the right to decide on Sunday shop opening hours. Despite positive effects on economic growth and employment, many municipalities restrict Sunday trading in one way or another. Based on 2003 data we show that especially religious and political affiliation, regional differences and the size of the municipalities explain the variation between between municipalities. The number and size of shops and household characteristics are significant although their influence seems to be smaller. There is less evidence that excessive competition with neighbouring municipalities induces shop opening on Sundays, although cross-border shopping seems to play a role. Population density has no effect.']

description oai_dc:dc/dc:description/text() [u'Policymakers\u2019 efforts to boost trend output growth may be hampered by the presence of a tradeoff between productivity gains and job creation. This paper presents empirical evidence that the negative relationship between productivity growth and employment growth that prevailed in the 1960s and 1970s has disappeared since then. This finding is robust to using alternative measures and including other explanatory variables. The improved tradeoff may be good news for policymakers who aim at raising the \u2018speed limit\u2019 of the economy.']
