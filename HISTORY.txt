oaipmh changelog
================

2.0
===

Changes
-------

* Add support for day-only granularity (YYYY-MM-DD) in client.
  calling 'updateGranularity' with the client will check with the
  server (using identify()) to see what granularity the server
  supports.  If the server only supports day level granularity, the
  client will make sure only YYYY-MM-DD timestamps are sent.

2.0b1
=====

Changes
-------

* Added framework for implementing OAI-PMH compliant servers.

* Changed package structure: now a oaipmh namespace package. Client
  functionality now in oaipmh.client.

* Refactoring of oaipmh.py module to reuse code for both client and
  server.

* Extended testing infrastructure.

* Switched over from using libxml2 Python wrappers to the lxml binding.

* Use generators instead of hacked up __getitem__. This means that the
  return from listRecords, listIdentifiers and listSets are now not
  normal lists but iterators. They can easily be turned into a normal
  list by using list() on them, however.

1.0.1 
=====

Bugs fixed
----------

* Typo in oaipmh.py

1.0
===

Bugs fixed
----------

* Added an encoding parameter to the serialize call, which fixes a
  unicode bug.

0.7.4
=====

Bugs fixed
----------

* A harvest can return records with <header status="deleted"> that
  contain no metadata and are merely an indication that that
  metadata-set for that resource is no longer on the OAI service.
  These records should be used to remove metadata from the catalog if
  it is there, bur should never be stored or catalogued
  themselves. They aren't now. (Fixed in zope/OAICore/core.py)
