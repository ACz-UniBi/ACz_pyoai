  unicode bug.

0.7.4
=====

Bugs fixed
----------

* A harvest can return records with <header status="deleted"> that
  contain no metadata and are merely an indication that that
  metadata-set for that resource is no longer on the OAI service.
  These records should be used to remove metadata from the catalog if
  it is there, bur should never be stored or catalogued
  themselves. They aren't now. (Fixed in zope/OAICore/core.py)
