oaipmh changelog

under development
=================

Changes
-------

* switch over from using libxml2 Python wrappers to the lxml binding.

* introduced oaipmh namespace package, and move client functionality
  into oaipmh.client.

* Use generators instead of hacked up __getitem__. This means that the
  return from listRecords, listIdentifiers and listSets are now not
  normal lists but iterators. They can easily be turned into a normal
  list by using list() on them, however.

1.0.1 
=====

Bugs fixed

Bugs fixed
----------

* Added an encoding parameter to the serialize call, which fixes a
  unicode bug.

0.7.4
=====

Bugs fixed
----------

* A harvest can return records with <header status="deleted"> that
  contain no metadata and are merely an indication that that
  metadata-set for that resource is no longer on the OAI service.
  These records should be used to remove metadata from the catalog if
  it is there, bur should never be stored or catalogued
  themselves. They aren't now. (Fixed in zope/OAICore/core.py)

Initial public release.
